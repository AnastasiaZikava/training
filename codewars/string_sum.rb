=begin
Compare two strings by comparing the sum of their values (ASCII character code).
For comparing treat all letters as UpperCase.
Null-Strings should be treated as if they are empty strings.
If the string contains other characters than letters, treat the whole string as
it would be empty.
Examples:
"AD","BC" -> equal
"AD","DD" -> not equal
"gf","FG" -> equal
"zz1","" -> equal
"ZzZz", "ffPFF" -> equal
"kl", "lz" -> not equal
null, "" -> equal
Your method should return true, if the strings are equal and false if they are
not equal.
